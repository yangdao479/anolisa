//! Lifecycle hook runner.
//!
//! Components can declare per-phase scripts (`pre_enable`, `post_enable`,
//! `pre_disable`, `post_disable`, …) in their manifest. The runner is the
//! one place those scripts get executed; CLI handlers call into it during
//! the lifecycle phases instead of shelling out themselves so the
//! enforcement story stays uniform:
//!
//!   1. **Path-safety**: the script path is validated against
//!      [`crate::path_safety::validate_owned_path`]. A hook that lives
//!      outside ANOLISA's owned roots (`/etc/passwd-pre-enable.sh`, a
//!      symlink-into-`/etc`, etc.) is refused without ever running.
//!      Components cannot opt out of this guard — third-party packages
//!      ship hooks under `<datadir>/hooks/<component>/...` and that's it.
//!   2. **Execution**: the script runs as a child process with a bounded
//!      timeout. Exit 0 = success, anything else = failure. The runner
//!      captures stderr (tail) + duration so callers can include the
//!      detail in a wider operation log.
//!   3. **Auditability**: every hook attempt — success, failure, AND
//!      refusal due to path-safety or missing script — emits a
//!      [`LogKind::Component`] record to the central log so
//!      `anolisa logs` shows the hook in context with the operation that
//!      triggered it. Hooks are best-effort by default: a failed hook
//!      surfaces as a warning on the parent operation rather than aborting
//!      the whole verb. Callers that need a strict gate (rare today) can
//!      escalate by checking `outcome.success` explicitly.
//!
//! The runner is intentionally synchronous and side-effect-free at the
//! state-file level: it does NOT mutate `installed.toml`. Callers that
//! want the hook outcome reflected in state (e.g. record `last_run_at`
//! per phase) take care of it themselves under the install lock.

/// the first hard failure and `HookRunResult.hard_failure` is set). The
/// caller is expected to translate `hard_failure` into a verb-level
/// error and append a `failed` audit record. `post_*` phases pass
