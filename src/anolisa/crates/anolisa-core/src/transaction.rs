//! Atomic lifecycle transactions with rollback support.
//!
//! A [`Transaction`] is a small journal that lifecycle operations
//! (install / enable / disable / uninstall / purge) can plug into to get
//! crash-safe behaviour without each call site re-implementing the
//! "snapshot → mutate → rollback on error" dance.
//!
//! The shape is intentionally concrete:
//!
//! 1. `begin` mints a sortable `operation_id`, snapshots the existing
//!    `state_path` bytes (if any), and writes an empty journal file under
//!    `journal_dir/<operation_id>.journal.toml`.
//! 2. Each meaningful side effect (writing a file, modifying state,
//!    starting a service, …) records a [`TransactionStep`] up front with
//!    `Planned` status. The journal is rewritten atomically (`tmp` →
//!    `rename`) on every change so the file on disk is never half-written.
//! 3. On success the orchestrator calls [`Transaction::mark_done`]; on
//!    failure it calls [`Transaction::mark_failed`] and walks the journal
//!    backwards calling rollback primitives.
//! 4. After a crash, [`Transaction::load_journal`] reads the file back in
//!    so a later `repair` command can finish or rewind the operation.
//!
//! Journal format is TOML (human-greppable, lines up with `installed.toml`
//! and `enable-plan.toml`) and is rewritten in full on every mutation —
//! steps lists are short (tens of entries per op at most) so the cost is
//! negligible, and a single rewrite-and-rename guarantees the on-disk
//! file always parses.
//!
//! AgentSight is not mentioned anywhere on purpose: this primitive is
//! shared by every component the package manager knows about.

    // --- write_atomic hardening: tmp-symlink TOCTOU regression suite.
    //
    // Testing approach (documented inline because it's a bit non-obvious):
    //
    // The random suffix in `tmp_path_for` means we can't race-fully plant a
    // symlink at the exact tmp path that the production code will pick.
    // Instead we exercise the two invariants directly:
    //
    //   1. `open_excl_nofollow` is extracted as a private helper and tested
    //      against a pre-placed symlink at a *known* path. This is the
    //      primitive that closes the TOCTOU hole; if it ever regresses to
    //      following symlinks the test fires immediately.
    //
    //   2. `tmp_path_for` is exercised end-to-end via `write_atomic` to
    //      confirm (a) two back-to-back writes don't collide and (b) a
    //      symlink planted at the *final* target gets atomically replaced
    //      by the rename (which is the documented unix `rename(2)` behaviour
    //      — the symlink itself, not its target, is replaced).
