//! Lifecycle plan + executor for `uninstall` / `purge` of components.
//!
//! Both teardown verbs share a single data model — [`LifecyclePlan`] —
//! built from the questions every destructive verb must answer before
//! touching the system:
//!
//!   1. What files / services does this component own?
//!   2. Which of those files are ANOLISA-owned (safe to remove) vs.
//!      external (must be preserved)?
//!   3. What service-stop / hook phases would run, and which ones are
//!      shipped today vs. deferred?
//!   4. What is the blast radius — privilege, risk level, irreversible
//!      operations — and what rollback advice can we give if the user
//!      cancels mid-flight?
//!
//! The plan is *data-only*: callers can render it for `--dry-run` /
//! `--json` without performing any IO. Only the executor (when invoked
//! without `--dry-run`) actually mutates the filesystem and state.
//!
//! # Scope guarantees (hard rules)
//!
//! * `Uninstall` — removes only files where `owner ==
//!   FileOwner::Anolisa`; everything else is skipped or refused.
//! * `Purge` — `Uninstall` semantics + drops ANOLISA-owned config / cache
//!   fragments. `external_modified_files` always
//!   [`FileActionKind::Refuse`]. `--force` is wire-level only for now;
//!   the executor treats it as deferred follow-up work.
//!
//! No AgentSight-specific code lives here — the plan is shaped from
//! [`InstalledState`] alone, which is what `install_runner` already
//! writes.
//!
//! # Transaction integration
//!
//! `Uninstall` opens a [`crate::transaction::Transaction`] **inside** the
//! install lock, after the authoritative state load. `Transaction::begin`
//! mints the operation id, snapshots `installed.toml`, and writes an
//! empty journal under `state_dir/journal/<operation_id>.journal.toml`.
//! Each removable file is:
//!
//!   1. backed up to `state_dir/backups/<operation_id>/<idx>.bak`,
//!   2. recorded as a `Planned` step whose
//!      [`RollbackActionKind::RestoreFile`](crate::transaction::RollbackActionKind::RestoreFile)
//!      points at the backup (with sha256),
//!   3. unlinked, then
//!   4. flipped to `Done` on success.
//!
//! On any post-deletion failure (`state.save`, the `succeeded` log entry,
//! a `Transaction` error itself) the executor walks done steps in reverse
//! calling `tx.restore_file`, then `tx.restore_state` to put back the
//! pre-op `installed.toml` bytes, marks the failing step `Failed`, and
//! `tx.finish(RolledBack)`. Transaction errors propagate to the caller as
//! [`LifecycleError::Transaction`] — the executor does not swallow them.
//!
//! `Purge` keeps the legacy plan-only gate (`check_destructive_execute_gate`)
//! until manifest-driven config discovery lands; until then the verb still emits a structured plan via
//! `--dry-run` and refuses to execute.
