//! Backend-neutral package *mutation* contract.
//!
//! [`PackageTransaction`] is the write-side counterpart to
//! [`PackageQuery`](crate::pkg_query::PackageQuery): where the query contract
//! only reads rpmdb / repo metadata, this one runs the package-manager
//! transactions ANOLISA delegates to dnf/rpm — `install`, `update`, and
//! `remove`, used by `anolisa install` / `update` / `uninstall` for
//! `rpm-observed` and `rpm-managed` components.
//!
//! The trait is object-safe so the CLI can hold a `&dyn PackageTransaction`
//! and inject a fake in tests instead of shelling out to a live `dnf`.
//! Privilege checks and post-transaction state refresh are the caller's
//! responsibility; this layer only spawns the transaction and classifies its
//! outcome.
