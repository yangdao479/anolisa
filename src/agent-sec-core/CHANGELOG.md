# Changelog

## 0.11.1

**Prompt Scanner**

- Restricted the invisible-character injection rule so emoji ZWJ sequences, Persian ZWNJ, and leading BOM no longer score as critical injections. (#2900)
- Refused non-loopback model service base URLs derived from the environment in both the Rust and Python model service paths. (#2893)
- Reported `daemon.health` prompt_scan state as untracked instead of unconditionally ready now that scanning runs in-process. (#2892)
- Dropped the dead prompt model preload environment flag and the obsolete scan-prompt protocol document. (#2886)

**Skill Ledger Runtime**

- Skipped host-backed read-only system Skills in batch `scan --all` and default `init` instead of failing them. (#2906)
- Rejected the placeholder `set-policy` and `rotate-keys` commands so they no longer report false success. (#2876)

**Asset Verification**

- Reported explicit `CHECKED` / `PASSED` / `FAILED` counters and a distinct zero-candidate outcome for `agent-sec-cli verify`. (#2875)

**Security Events & CLI**

- Enforced owner-only permissions on files created by the CLI. (#2873)

**Documentation**

- Documented the five hidden `agent-sec-cli` integration commands and their contract caveats. (#2887)
