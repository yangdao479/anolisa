//! Home-directory resolution rooted in the passwd database.
//!
//! Every tokenless crate that writes state under the user's home (config,
//! stats DB, log files) must agree on what "home" means. Reading `$HOME`
//! directly is unsafe — a parent process can set it to anything before
//! invoking the binary, redirecting state files into attacker-writable
//! paths. This module derives the home directory from `getpwuid_r(getuid())`
//! and refuses to fall back to anything that reads `$HOME` (dirs::home_dir,
//! std::env, etc.); a missing passwd entry must surface as an empty string
//! so callers can refuse `$HOME`-relative writes rather than silently
//! redirecting them into an attacker-controlled location.

/// Resolve the current user's home directory.
///
/// Returns an empty string when no trusted home anchor is available; callers
/// must treat that as "no $HOME-relative writes" rather than using `.` or
/// $HOME as a fallback (either would silently place state wherever the
/// binary was invoked from or wherever a parent process pointed $HOME).
