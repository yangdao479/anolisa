//! Skill Security lifecycle namespace reservation (Packages S3 + S3.1).
//!
//! Future Skill Security packages will use a small set of reserved top-level
//! directory names — `.staging`, `.certified`, `.quarantine`, `.archive` — to
//! drive lifecycle transitions (staging → certified → active →
//! quarantined / archived). Package S3 reserved the names so the boundary
//! cannot be re-used for ordinary skills.
//!
//! Package S3.1 layers a *pure* management-view contract on top of that
//! reservation: [`LifecycleViewMode`] distinguishes the ordinary
//! agent-facing view (where reserved roots stay hidden and immutable) from
//! a future management view (where the same roots are intentionally exposed
//! to a trusted writer / management tool). The helpers in this module
//! centralize that decision. S3.1 ships only the contract — no FUSE
//! callback consults [`LifecycleViewMode::Management`] today and no CLI
//! flag turns it on. Default behavior is exactly the S3 behavior: ordinary
//! mounts hide and deny reserved roots.
//!
//! Helpers in this module are pure-lexical (no syscalls, no follow). They
//! centralize the "is this a reserved lifecycle namespace name?" and "may
//! this view see / mutate the name?" decisions so FUSE callbacks and
//! future policy implementations agree on the answer.
