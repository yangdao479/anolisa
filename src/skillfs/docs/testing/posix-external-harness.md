# SkillFS POSIX External Test Harness

**Status**: Optional. Not invoked by `cargo test` or `scripts/test.sh`.
**Script**: [`scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh`](../../scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh)
**Manifests** (three buckets, each populated against an upstream
citation — see ["Adding to a manifest"](#adding-to-a-manifest)):
- [`scripts/posix/expected_fail.txt`](../../scripts/posix/expected_fail.txt)
  — direct unsupported surface (link / symlink / mkfifo / mknod /
  posix_fallocate / chflags).
- [`scripts/posix/blocked_dependent.txt`](../../scripts/posix/blocked_dependent.txt)
  — test files whose own setup uses an unsupported surface
  (`create_file fifo|block|char|socket`, internal `symlink`,
  hardlink "multiply linked").
- [`scripts/posix/caller_identity.txt`](../../scripts/posix/caller_identity.txt)
  — test files that require POSIX semantics SkillFS does not
  currently emulate: per-caller uid/gid fidelity (`pjdfstest -u <uid>
  -g <gid>`), sticky-bit (`S_ISVTX`) enforcement on rename/rmdir,
  and `lchmod` probes.

## What The Harness Does

The harness drives an external POSIX conformance suite (pjdfstest)
against a real SkillFS FUSE mount. It keeps conformance runs optional
and reports failures in actionable buckets (unsupported surface,
blocked helper dependency, caller-identity gap, unexpected failure).
The harness itself changes no filesystem behavior. It:

1. Builds the `skillfs` binary (debug by default; `--release` for the
   release binary).
2. Creates a temporary source/mount pair and a single normal skill
   (`harness-skill`) with a writable passthrough subdirectory
   (`sandbox/`).
3. Mounts SkillFS over that source in the default non-in-place layout.
4. Selects a subset of pjdfstest's `tests/**/*.t` files based on the
   `--profile` / `--include` / `--exclude` rules below, then runs
   `prove` against that selection with cwd set to
   `skills/harness-skill/sandbox/` so every test creates its temp files
   inside the SkillFS passthrough sandbox.
5. Classifies each failing pjdfstest file into one of three buckets
   (see ["Interpreting the Report"](#interpreting-the-report)).
6. Optionally re-runs the unexpected bucket with `prove -v` for
   investigation.
7. Tears the mount down via `fusermount3 -u` and removes the temp tree
   (pass `--keep` to retain it).

The sandbox path was chosen deliberately to keep the harness out of
all SkillFS-specific surfaces: it never reads or writes
`skill-discover/SKILL.md`, `<skill>/SKILL.md`, `.skill-meta/`, or
lifecycle reserved roots (`.staging`, `.certified`, `.quarantine`,
`.archive`). That keeps the harness a pure POSIX passthrough probe.

## Why pjdfstest Is Not a Cargo Dependency

pjdfstest is an external C/autotools project that must be built on the
target host and **requires root** to run. Pulling it into `cargo test`
would make the in-tree test matrix depend on root, a clean autotools
chain, and a built C binary that does not ship with this repo. The
harness keeps the dependency optional: if `prove`, `fusermount3`,
root, or the pjdfstest checkout are missing, it exits with code `2`
and a single actionable hint per missing prerequisite.

## Host Prerequisites

Linux only (pjdfstest does not target macOS as a host). Install once:

```sh
# Build and runtime deps for pjdfstest itself.
sudo dnf install -y autoconf automake gcc make perl perl-Test-Harness fuse3
# Or, on Debian/Ubuntu:
# sudo apt install -y autoconf automake gcc make perl perl-modules fuse3
```

You also need write access to `/dev/fuse`. On most images, root has
this by default.

## Installing pjdfstest

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest.git ~/pjdfstest
cd ~/pjdfstest
autoreconf -ifs
./configure
make pjdfstest
```

The build produces an executable named `pjdfstest` at the repo root.
The test scripts under `tests/` walk upward to find it, so we just
need to hand the harness the checkout path.

## Running the Harness

```sh
# Default smoke profile: excludes both manifests, runs the rest.
sudo SKILLFS_PJDFSTEST_DIR=~/pjdfstest scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh \
  --report /tmp/skillfs-smoke.txt

# Full profile: runs every *.t under tests/.
sudo scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh --pjdfstest ~/pjdfstest \
  --profile full --report /tmp/skillfs-full.txt

# Verbose rerun of any residual unexpected failures.
sudo scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh --pjdfstest ~/pjdfstest \
  --rerun-failures-verbose --keep
```

All flags:

| Flag                                | Effect                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--pjdfstest <PATH>`                | pjdfstest checkout (must contain built `./pjdfstest` and `./tests/`). Overrides env var.          |
| `--release`                         | Build/run the release `skillfs` binary.                                                           |
| `--profile smoke\|full`             | Default `smoke`: skip every glob from all three manifests. `full`: run every test file.           |
| `--include <PATTERNS>`              | Comma-separated globs (relative to `tests/`). When set, only matching files run. Repeatable.      |
| `--exclude <PATTERNS>`              | Comma-separated globs to exclude. Stacks with profile excludes and wins over `--include`.         |
| `--rerun-failures-verbose`          | After the main run, re-invoke `prove -v` against the unexpected-fail set into `rerun-verbose.log`.|
| `--expected-fail <PATH>`            | Override the expected-fail manifest.                                                              |
| `--blocked-manifest <PATH>`         | Override the blocked-dependent manifest.                                                          |
| `--caller-identity-manifest <PATH>` | Override the caller-identity manifest.                                                            |
| `--report <PATH>`                   | Write the final summary to PATH (also printed on stdout).                                         |
| `--keep`                            | Keep the temporary source/mount tree, mount log, prove log, and rerun log.                        |
| `--self-test`                       | Exercise the parser+classifier on canned input. No FUSE/sudo/pjdfstest required. Exits 0 / 4.     |
| `-h`, `--help`                      | Show CLI help and exit.                                                                           |

Environment overrides:

- `SKILLFS_PJDFSTEST_DIR` — same as `--pjdfstest` (CLI flag wins).
- `SKILLFS_POSIX_KEEP=1` — same as `--keep`.

### Selection order

For each `tests/**/*.t`, the harness applies, in this order:

1. `--include` globs (if any). A non-matching file is dropped.
2. `--exclude` globs. A matching file is dropped (wins over include).
3. `--profile smoke` ⇒ drop files matching **any** of the three
   manifests (expected-fail, blocked-dependent, caller-identity).
   `--profile full` ⇒ no manifest-based drop.

The remaining list is the prove input. Manifest classification of
**failing** files still happens at report time regardless of profile.

## Interpreting the Report

The harness prints a single summary block. Example:

```
SkillFS External POSIX Harness Report

  ! mkdir/03.t
  ! open/02.t
  ! open/03.t
  ! rename/02.t
  ! rmdir/03.t
  ! truncate/03.t
  ! unlink/03.t
  ! unlink/14.t

verdict: UNEXPECTED_FAILURES (8 real failing files; investigate before promoting to a manifest)
```

Read it as follows:

- **`prove exit`**: prove's own exit status. Non-zero whenever any
  test file fails or any subtest is `not ok`; the harness still
  reports `OK` if every failing file matched a manifest.
- **`prove summary`**: the raw `Files=…, Tests=…` and `Result:` lines
  from prove. Use them to spot wholesale regressions (e.g. test count
  collapsed to zero — usually a mount or build problem; see the prove
  log).
- **expected fails (unsupported surface)**: failing test files whose
  relative path matches a pattern in `expected_fail.txt`. Each
  corresponds to a SkillFS surface we deliberately have not
  implemented yet (symlink creation, hard links, mkfifo/mknod,
  fallocate, BSD-only `chflags/`).
- **blocked fails (depends on unsupported helper)**: failing test
  files matching `blocked_dependent.txt`. pjdfstest's own setup
  inside these files calls an unsupported helper (`create_file
  fifo|block|char|socket`, internal `symlink`/`mkfifo`/`mknod`,
  hardlink "multiply linked"), so the file cannot run end to end on
  SkillFS until that surface lands.
- **caller-identity fails (uid/gid/sticky/lchmod semantics gap)**:
  failing test files matching `caller_identity.txt`. The targeted op
  may work, but pjdfstest's subtests assert behavior under
  `-u <uid> -g <gid>`, sticky-bit owner mismatch, or `lchmod`
  semantics that the SkillFS FUSE daemon does not currently
  emulate. Lands when a future package wires `req.uid()` /
  `req.gid()` through to the underlying syscall (e.g. via FUSE
  `default_permissions` plus per-call seteuid/setegid in worker
  threads).
- **unexpected fails**: failing test files matching none of the
  three manifests.
  Each is a real signal — either a SkillFS regression on a surface we
  believe is supported, or a host/filesystem condition that the
  manifest needs to acknowledge explicitly. **Investigate before
  expanding either manifest** — see the manifest-citation rule below.
  Use `--rerun-failures-verbose` to get a `prove -v` of just these
  files into `rerun-verbose.log`.

`verdict: OK` ⇒ exit `0`. `verdict: UNEXPECTED_FAILURES` ⇒ exit `3`.
Any setup error (missing pjdfstest, missing prove, not root,
`/dev/fuse` absent, build failure, mount timeout) ⇒ exit `2` with a
one-line hint.

## Adding to a manifest

All three manifests use the same syntax — one glob per line, `#`
for comments. A glob is matched against the test file's relative
path under `tests/` (e.g. `link/00.t`, `chmod/*`).

**Hard rule (applies to all three manifests)**: each glob must be
immediately preceded by a `#` comment naming the upstream pjdfstest
file and the exact dependency reason. "It failed in the baseline" is
**not** a citation — entries without a concrete upstream pointer are
not allowed. If a failure cannot be cited, it stays in the unexpected
bucket and surfaces in the verbose rerun for follow-up. This rule
exists so a future maintainer can re-audit the manifest after a
SkillFS feature lands and know exactly which entries to remove.

Reverse audit: when a Phase 2 package implements one of the
expected-fail surfaces (symlink creation, hardlink, mkfifo/mknod,
fallocate), remove the corresponding entry from `expected_fail.txt`
and re-run the harness — failures that used to be expected become
real signal at that point. Likewise, when an unsupported-helper
surface ships, audit `blocked_dependent.txt`; when per-caller
uid/gid fidelity lands, audit `caller_identity.txt`. Every removed
entry should let the harness surface the same files in the
unexpected bucket, where they get re-investigated.

## Self-test

The harness ships a `--self-test` mode that exercises the prove-output
parser and the manifest classifier on canned input. It runs locally
without FUSE, sudo, or a pjdfstest binary and is useful for
regression-checking the parse path:

```sh
bash scripts/posix/run_pjdfstest.sh --self-test
```

Expected output: four `ok:` lines (one per canonical bucket) and
`[self-test] OK`. Exit code `0` on success, `4` on classification
mismatch.

## What This Harness Does Not Cover

By design, the harness is visibility / refinement only. Out of scope:

- Exercising every policy-controlled or advanced Linux filesystem
  surface. Unsupported or partially supported areas remain visible in
  the manifests and `POSIX_FS_TEST_MATRIX.csv`.
- Changing SKILL.md compiled read/write semantics, skill-discover
  semantics, `.skill-meta` protection, or lifecycle namespace policy.
  The sandbox path is chosen specifically so pjdfstest never crosses
  those boundaries.
- Adding pjdfstest as a cargo or CI dependency. Normal `cargo test`
  and `scripts/test.sh` must continue to pass without pjdfstest.
- Caller-identity fidelity in the FUSE filesystem (the `pjdfstest -u
  <uid> -g <gid>` switches). Several `truncate/`, `unlink/`,
  `chown/` files exercise permission semantics that depend on the
  FUSE daemon honoring per-caller uid/gid; that is tracked separately.
